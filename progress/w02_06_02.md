### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was  overwhelmed  because I feel as if I am not contributing to the open source with unsuccessful pull requests 
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more grateful because I am learning new things each and everyday

- I find the project to be challenging me

- My level of stress is manageable.
